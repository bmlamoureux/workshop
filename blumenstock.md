What is the promise of data science?
- Blumenstock notes that data science algorithms can detect patterns of human development which can be defined as the act of enlarging peopl'es opportunities and improving their way of life. For example, Blumenstock mentioned how algorithms and satellite imagery can weed out the wealthy and the poor just by the roofs of their houses. This in turn, relates to how many international calls a certain household makes. The promise Blumenstock is making is that data science such as the method used in this example can possibly aid in solving child malnutrition. Governments can focus on locations in Africa that make less international phone calls and have more thatched roofs, and send any aid needed. 

What are the pitfalls?
- Data science could transform international development, but there are at least 4 pitfalls that concern researchers such as Blumenstock. These pitfalls include unanticipated effects, lack of validation, biased algorithms, and lack of regulation. Out of the 4 major problems associated with big data, which can be defined as very large data sets that can be analyzed and lead to patterns and trends that strive to answer human behavior questions, Blumenstock's biggest concern is that of biased algorithms. Biased algorithms can occur when tools are trained on data that is patchy or even on data that is marginalized. This is a major concern in emerging economies, which is what the idea of big data is striving to find solutions for. Disadvantaged people are not getting the recognition they thought they would. 

Ways forward?
- Blumenstock is hinting at an attempt at merging the new and old ways of data science. The idea that new sources of data should be considered right along side old sources is possibly the best way to move forward and see the results we want to see. Everyone must work together: data scientists, development experts, governments, civil society, and the private sector. This way, we can avoid some issues such as biased algorithms in order to include everyone, even the people that are poorly represented. 

In Conclusion, 
- Data scientists and human developers should work together in all aspects to insure the promises of big data are met. Another way to move forward in the process is to get researchers out on the field. Problems arise when there is no understanding about what is actually happening. We need people out in the world getting a feel for the real world happenings. This will improve our data and hopefully improve human development and their qualities of life.
