# Question: How  did  the  transformation  of  the  City  of  God  provide  evidence  for  how  social
networks were central to Rio de Janeiro’s urbanization during the 60s, 70s & 80s?

# Response 

Geoff West describes social networks as being a major part of the transformation of cities and their urbanization. Cities can be compared to people in the sense that people are all the same all over the world, and how they interact with one another is the same. Yes, people look, speak, and dress differently, but we are all the same, our networks are the same. The social networks that humans have evolved to have through the exchange of information and language can be used for innovation and wealth. Basically, the more social your networks are, the stronger they are, and the more wealth you are likely to have. However, while cities like Rio seem quite shiny, they have a dark side. Poverty, disease, consumption of energy and resources, and servings as a prime location of prime bring us to the true story and film, the City of God. 

Networks between the livers of Cidade de Deus tell the true story about Rio de Janerio’s rise to urbanization from the 60s to the 80s. Interactions between different persons throughout the film depict the future and fate of many. Each individual’s path leads them to a different ending, except if you found yourself getting into trouble, gangs, and violence. Most characters such as Goose, Li’l Dice (Li’l Ze), and Benny meet a very untimely death thanks to their networks. While their networks are social, they are filled with violence and vengeance. They get caught in a loop that can only end in the grave. After the film comes full circle, Li’l Ze thinks he managed to escape this treacherous cycle when he is met by the young gang, the Runts. He is murdered out of vengeance for killing one of their gang members earlier in the film. While the film doesn’t clearly state this, the gang members have now fallen into the same social trap Li’l Ze was once apart of. This is an example of the way social networks acted in a negative way towards society, almost like a parasite in biology. However, at the end of the film, Rocket decided to do the “right thing” and turn in the pictures of Li’l Ze’s dead body to the newspaper, rather than risk putting himself in the possible cycle of revenge, violence, and betrayal and turning in the pictures of cops. Rocket now can get a job at the newspaper company, make a living, and start urbanizing Rio. He is the start of a social networking urbanization chain and his entire life and the events that unfolded lead him to it. 

Back to West, he introduces the idea of scale and how most things, even biology, changes with size. A great example West uses in his book, Scale, is how as a city grows, so does the amount of social activity, then the amount of opportunity, and then wages increase, and there is more diversity, and this leads to more restaurants, and concerts and a “sense of buzz.” This cycle of growth and urbanization blinds people from the idea that cities could potentially be very negative. As Rio de Janeiro started to grow, it followed this cycle, and just like an animal and it’s metabolic rate, it needs more food the bigger it gets. Rio is highly complex, meaning it’s composed of trillions of individual constituents which are all connected in some way via their
networks. 

Tobler’s First Law of Geography relates quite nicely with the story’s of the young holigans wandering the streets of the City of God and Geoff West’s idea of social networking. “Everything is related to everything, but near things are more related than distant things.” Throughout the film, it seemed that everyone in the favela met their expected and deserved fate, whether it is jail, death, or success. The phrase “everything happens for a reason,” is an excellent example of how you must look at life and your networks. Everything that happened to these young gangsters came back to them, each person’s destiny was written long before it actually came to life, thanks to networking. The transformation of the City of God provides evidence that things changed for Rio and people such as Rocket were the start.
