## Introduction

The purpose of this research is to advance the use of different post-disaster management techniques in low-income countries such as Haiti. By estimating, specifying, and analyzing cell phone SIM card movements, social media 3-T frameworks, and automatic object-oriented techniques, just to name a few, researchers and rescuers alike will be able to decrease the mortality rate of Haitians following natural disasters. Though traditional methods worked well for a long period of time, they lacked the ability to prioritize data that flowed in from outside sources, which is crucial being that Haiti is the least developed country in the Western Hemisphere. I will achieve the goals of increasing response time post-disaster and becoming more prepared pre-disaster using methods such as:
  1. The use of automatic mapping to measure infrastructure damage to provide rapid assessments of building damage. 
  2. Estimate the magnitude of population movements after the Haiti 2010 earthquake.
  3. Connect responders on the ground to all information available around the world so they can respond accordingly to how,     when, and where supply resources need to be distributed. 

This work will build on previous traditional methods of response that were time and labor-intensive and only circulated information among a small number of researchers. This method has proved to be effective for a number of years but as the risk of more dangerous natural disasters continues to grow, building upon these techniques with the use of methods mentioned previously will save more lives in low-income countries such as Haiti. 

## Human Development Topic

Haiti has suffered from many natural disasters in its’ history. Form earthquakes to diseases and hurricanes, Haiti has been put through the wringer. Over 31,600 Haitians lost their lives or have yet to be found after the monstrous 2010 earthquake. Why is it that low-income countries such as Haiti feel the rath of natural disasters so harshly? Researchers have reason to believe that calculating death tolls after a disaster has already happened can calculate the number of rescue supplies needed, but, does nothing to prevent the amount of damage a natural disaster can do on a low-income country. Studies have found that there are new data science methods that could contribute greatly to the idea of prevention rather than forgiveness. Methods such as analyzing the movement of cell phone SIM cards, social media outlets such as Ushahidi, and remote sensing technology are all machine learning techniques that have proved to detect some sort of algorithm that can aid countries when responding, and trying to defend against natural disasters. While natural disasters are uncontrollable, research has proven that there are modern machine learning techniques that can be analyzed to decrease the death toll, and improve the safety of citizens living in low-income countries. 

Amartya  Sen defines human development as “The enhancement of freedoms that allow people to lead lives that they have reason to value” (Sen, 1999). The reason for this research and literature review is not to simply decrease the number of deaths in Haiti after a natural disaster, it is to consider every single number as human life, and every single life is a life worth living. Sen argues that there is too much emphasis on GDP as a measure of development. In this research, GDP can be compared to the mortality rate post-disaster. While this number is important for analysis, what’s more important is the idea that everyone’s lives have meaning and no one deserves to go through life without some kind of security that they will not survive a natural disaster. This research again describes how some modern technologies have proven to increase human development and quality of life through disaster management and response. 

Being a low-income country has many different meanings and levels. “Wealth is a relative term, however, and the Haitian peasant is so poor that by contrast a few hundred dollars’ income a year will seem like riches” (Lundahl, 2011, pg. 108). Haiti is very poor. They have very little money circulating through their economic system which means they need help from the rest of the world when it comes to disaster management and relief. When disaster strikes, Haiti needs help from around the world as fast as possible. One method used by volunteers around the world is the social media outlet known as Ushahidi. Ushahidi can provide reports of trapped people, medical emergencies, and specific needs such as food, water, and shelter. The information gathered is combined with geographic information and is available to anyone with an internet connection. Responders on the ground can now be connected to all information available and respond accordingly to how, when, and where supply resources need to be distributed. 

## Human Development Process

During the testing and analysis of different disease management and response techniques, there were many agents involved. Agents including the 3-T framework. The 3-T framework illustrates three different boundaries: syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic, each represents a different milestone of information. Traditional knowledge management systems (KMS) make it difficult to understand these boundaries since it is very manual. Using the 3-T framework, we can measure the amount of information being communicated across specific boundaries, leading to a positive increase in disaster management and response. One particular user of the 3-T framework includes social media outlet Ushahidi, mentioned earlier. “The platform could be considered ‘social’ as it provided several key functions of social media: it allowed web pages to be created ‘on the fly’ by anyone on the team… Further, all contributions were tagged with the contributor's name and contact information. Anyone who had a comment or additional information would know exactly who to contact for more information, or how to contextualize their response if they had information to share” (Yates, & Paquette, 2011). 

There are also 2 different processes for detecting earthquake damage: mono-temporal and multi-temporal. The mono-temporal approach is especially used when attempting to provide an effective emergency extraction of earthquake damage. It does not depend on how available pre-earthquake imagery is. One method of a mono-temporal approach is called support vector selection and adaptation. This method detects damaged regions from a post-earthquake image. The SVSA method uses support vectors from linear support vector machines. There are two stages to this method: selection and adaptation. First, in the selection stage, the linear SVM deployed to get the support vectors from the original training data. The support vector data is then classified with the training data with the K nearest neighbor algorithm created by Cover and Hart in 1967. In the adaptation stage, the remaining reference vector data are adapted to fit other training data and make them ready for classification and the nearest neighbor rule. The adaptation of data is obtained by using the Learning Vector Quantization algorithm. In a multi-temporal approach, damage and change can be detected through the analysis of registered multispectral remote sensing images acquired from the same geographical area and two different times. For example, Rathje deployed a semi-automatic thematic algorithm that identified damage patterns based on pre- and post-earthquake high-resolution images. A disadvantage of a multi-temporal approach using change detection could be something as simple as brightness values or a certain time gap between image timestamps.
