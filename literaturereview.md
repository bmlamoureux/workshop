## Introduction

The purpose of this research is to advance the use of different post-disaster management techniques in low-income countries such as Haiti. By estimating, specifying, and analyzing cell phone SIM card movements, social media 3-T frameworks, and automatic object-oriented techniques, just to name a few, researchers and rescuers alike will be able to decrease the mortality rate of Haitians following natural disasters. Though traditional methods worked well for a long period of time, they lacked the ability to prioritize data that flowed in from outside sources, which is crucial being that Haiti is the least developed country in the Western Hemisphere. I will achieve the goals of increasing response time post-disaster and becoming more prepared pre-disaster using methods such as:
  1. The use of automatic mapping to measure infrastructure damage to provide rapid assessments of building damage. 
  2. Estimate the magnitude of population movements after the Haiti 2010 earthquake.
  3. Connect responders on the ground to all information available around the world so they can respond accordingly to how,     when, and where supply resources need to be distributed. 

This work will build on previous traditional methods of response that were time and labor-intensive and only circulated information among a small number of researchers. This method has proved to be effective for a number of years but as the risk of more dangerous natural disasters continues to grow, building upon these techniques with the use of methods mentioned previously will save more lives in low-income countries such as Haiti.
