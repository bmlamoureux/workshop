Nieves used the random forest machine learning method to predict what value globally?

Nieves used the random forest machine learning method to predict how the population would be distributed, more importantly, population density. The results of population density would come during the second step in the random forest machine process. Nieves wanted to answer two important questions: “What datasets, representing drivers and associated landscapes of population distribution, are the most informative for accurately mapping populations at global scales?... What are the differences, in terms of the relative importance of these datasets, between countries, between regions of countries and within regions of countries?” (Nieves, 2017)
