  #Nieves used the random forest machine learning method to predict what value globally?

Nieves used the random forest machine learning method to predict how the population would be distributed, more importantly, population density. The results of population density would come during the second step in the random forest machine process. Nieves wanted to answer two important questions: “What datasets, representing drivers and associated landscapes of population distribution, are the most informative for accurately mapping populations at global scales?... What are the differences, in terms of the relative importance of these datasets, between countries, between regions of countries and within regions of countries?” (Nieves, 2017) 

  #What is a dasymetric population allocation? 
  
 A dasymetric population allocation has significantly evolved over time and gives information about commonalities between population and ancillary variables. A dasymetric population allocation is the third, and final step of the RF method. Using its redistributions of the population counted from census-based administrative units, the population density becomes a weighted layer. 

  #Which geospatial covariates proved to be the most important when predicting global values of where humans reside?
  
The geospatial covariates that proved to be the most important when predicting global values of where humans reside would be urban/suburban extents, built environment and urban/suburban proxies, climatic/environmental variables, populated place covariates, and transportation networks.
