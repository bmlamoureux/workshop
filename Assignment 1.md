    Problem Statement

Disaster management and relief in low income countries, such as Haiti, are very short of sufficient and can lead to slow responce times and higher mortality rates.

Haiti, unfortunately, has been victim to many natural disasters in recent history. One of which being a devastating earthquake reaching a magnitude of 7.0 in January of 2010. In a low income country such as Haiti, disaster management falls very short of sufficient. At the time Haiti was the poorest country in the Wesstern Hemisphere. The earthquake had no mercy when it wreaked havoc on the capital, Port-au-Prince, and destroyed about 60% of the city's government buildings and 80% of its schools. In this specific article, the use of automatic mapping was used to measure damage to infrastructure, and provide rapid assessments of building damage. 

In the study, optical images (15cm of spatial resolution) combined with height data (LiDAR, 1m of spatial resolution) measured building damage throughout the capital. This data was then organized into three categories of destruction: intact buildings, collapsed buildings, and debris. Through the use of this automatic object-oriented technique, the amount of damage done to each building is measured immediately and proved to be very reliable. The accuracy of classification varied from 70- 79 per cent. There were various reasons for error including: limited spectral information of the optical images, resolution difference between the two data, high density of buildings but most importantly, certain types of building collapses could not be detected by vertically taken images. The automatic damage mapping strategy discussed in this article could absolutely be used in emergency situations. The entire process took approximately 15 hours, which is much faster than any semi- or fully automatic technique that has been proposed in the past. Semi automatic techniques are based on visual interpretations of images and are very time and labor intensive. Automatic damage mapping could be combined with manual visual interpretation to increase and accelerate response times of humanitarian rescues and resources. 

Amartya Sen defined human development as the enhancement of freedoms that allow people to lead lives that they have reason to value. Freedoms such as transparent guarantees. Haiti in particular has a very limited amount of freedom. Haiti’s people are living in great poverty and struggle daily to survive. When disaster strikes, it is only right that their right to safety is protected and transparent. With automatic damage mapping, many lives could be saved and building restoration can be handled much quicker and efficiently. The people of Haiti rely heavily on this method of damage assessment to enhance their freedoms and improve their own capabilities, leading to a positive effect on human development.

In this research study, the goal was to test the idea that social media is flexible yet robust enough to understand the knowledge structures that align with how knowledge is gathered, shared, and deployed in a disaster response, in particular, the Haiti 2010 earthquake. Social media is responsible for the world's incredible response and involvement. For example, the earthquake prompted the U.S. Government to rely heavily on social media to gain knowledge and coordinate with the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. State Department, and the U.S. armed forces. If social media is effectively maintained, it can eliminate manually intensive knowledge sharing processes and provide quicker response times to victims. 

One social media/ collaborative tool that was used as a response tactic was Microsoft SharePoint. “The platform could be considered ‘social’ as it provided several key functions of social media: it allowed web pages to be created ‘on the fly’ by anyone on the team… Further, all contributions were tagged with the contributor's name and contact information. Anyone who had a comment or additional information would know exactly who to contact for more information, or how to contextualize their response if they had information to share” (Yates, & Paquette, 2011). Before Microsoft SharePoint, efforts were very linear. There are now mechanisms such as Intellink that develop a shared site that any user with access can access and share knowledge. The SharePoint system was able to cross over boundaries, translate knowledge, and convert that knowledge into understandable information across organizations. 

The impact of social media can be viewed through the 3-T framework. The 3-T framework illustrates three different boundaries: syntactic, semantic, and  pragmatic, each represents a different milestone of information. Traditional knowledge management systems (KMS) make it difficult to understand these boundaries since it is very manual. Social media has the ability to shortcut these outdated routines and connect with responders more directly and provide access to everyone's knowledge. 

Yates and Paquette are focusing on partnerships for the goals when attempting to enhance human development. Social media has the ability to increase public participation in disaster response, especially in a low income country such as Haiti. Strategies such as Microsoft SharePoint can increase the amount of knowledge known about a disaster and increase the amount of collaboration between responders there is.  Traditional response techniques were time and labor intensive. Using the 3-T framework, we can measure the amount of information being communicated across specific boundaries, leading to a positive increase in disaster management and response.
