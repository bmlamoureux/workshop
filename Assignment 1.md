​	Haiti, unfortunately, has been victim to many natural disasters in recent history. One of which being a devastating earthquake reaching a magnitude of 7.0 in January of 2010. In a low income country such as Haiti, disaster management falls very short of sufficient. At the time Haiti was the poorest country in the Wesstern Hemisphere. The earthquake had no mercy when it wreaked havoc on the capital, Port-au-Prince, and destroyed about 60% of the city's government buildings and 80% of its schools. In this specific article, the use of automatic mapping was used to measure damage to infrastructure, and provide rapid assessments of building damage. 

​	In the study, optical images (15cm of spatial resolution) combined with height data (LiDAR, 1m of spatial resolution) measured building damage throughout the capital. This data was then organized into three categories of destruction: intact buildings, collapsed buildings, and debris. Through the use of this automatic object-oriented technique, the amount of damage done to each building is measured immediately and proved to be very reliable. The accuracy of classification varied from 70- 79 per cent. There were various reasons for error including: limited spectral information of the optical images, resolution difference between the two data, high density of buildings but most importantly, certain types of building collapses could not be detected by vertically taken images. The automatic damage mapping strategy discussed in this article could absolutely be used in emergency situations. The entire process took approximately 15 hours, which is much faster than any semi- or fully automatic technique that has been proposed in the past. Semi automatic techniques are based on visual interpretations of images and are very time and labor intensive. Automatic damage mapping could be combined with manual visual interpretation to increase and accelerate response times of humanitarian rescues and resources. 

​	Amartya Sen defined human development as the enhancement of freedoms that allow people to lead lives that they have reason to value. Freedoms such as transparent guarantees. Haiti in particular has a very limited amount of freedom. Haiti’s people are living in great poverty and struggle daily to survive. When disaster strikes, it is only right that their right to safety is protected and transparent. With automatic damage mapping, many lives could be saved and building restoration can be handled much quicker and efficiently. The people of Haiti rely heavily on this method of damage assessment to enhance their freedoms and improve their own capabilities, leading to a positive effect on human development.
