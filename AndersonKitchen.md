### Anderson, Kitchen Responce:

The idea that big data killed theory is one backed by massive amounts of information and mathematics. Why do people do what they do? Data nowadays can answer anything. The Wired article states that the scientific method is built around theory and any theory can be answered using numbers. Kitchen, on the other hand, states that theory is not in fact, dead, theory can just be backed by new revolutions in measurement and data science. I agree strongly with Kitchen when he explains that there is an urgent need for wider critical reflection on data revolution and that rapid changes need to take place.  Kitchen also points out that the analysis of Big Data can present many challenges including its abundance, exhaustivity, and variety. Big Data is also timeless and constantly changing. In my opinion, we have not entered a paradigm revolution where everything can be explained through patterns and numbers. Though Big Data has the ability to answer many questions, correlation does not take the place of causation. Humans will always be needed to answer questions and computers will never take their place. One rebuttal could be that humans are biased, but their methods and strategies will always be stronger and more effective than just computers.
