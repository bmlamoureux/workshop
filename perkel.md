## Notes

1. Oliver Gruebner:  He applied a ‘sentiment detection’ algorithm to Twitter posts that included location data (‘geotagged’ tweets) following such events as the landfall of Hurricane Sandy in New York in 2012, and the 2015 terrorist attack in Paris. This let him identify regional clusters of emotional trauma — a finding that could help in deploying limited mental-health resources. 

2. The challenge comes when researchers attempt more detailed analyses than simply plotting points
- Many mapping applications can calculate distance and area, for instance, but QGIS has plug-ins for tasks such as classifying land coverage (using categories such as forest or desert), measuring ground slope, calculating travel times, and modelling the path of flowing water.

3. Another challenge:  that mapping data can be represented using any of several projections (If different data sets use different projections, overlaying multiple datasets will result in locations not matching up.)

4. Mapping data can also come in two basic forms: Vector files, Raster files 

5. Programming tools provide an attractive alternative to desktop tools, says Rey. “They’re just a lot more flexible.”

6. They also foster reproducibility, because researchers can repeat runs while specifying exactly which version of the code to use

7. Coding also allows you to use the most up-todate algorithms, which typically are developed in languages such as R or Python
